/* ANSI sez:
 *   The `strncpy' function copies not more than `n' characters (characters
 *   that follow a null character are not copied) from the array pointed to
 *   by `s2' to the array pointed to by `s1'.  If copying takes place between
 *   objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
 *   If the array pointed to by `s2' is a string that is shorter than `n'
 *   characters, null characters are appended to the copy in the array
 *   pointed to by `s1', until `n' characters in all have been written.
 *   The `strncpy' function returns the value of `s1'.  [4.11.2.4]
