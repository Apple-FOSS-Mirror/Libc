; Strlen, optimized for PPC.  The routine we use is 2-3x faster
; then the simple loop which checks each byte for zero.
; For 0- and 1-byte strings, the simple routine is faster, but
; only by a few cycles.  The algorithm used was adapted from the
; Mac OS 9 stdCLib strcopy routine, which was originally
; written by Gary Davidian.  It relies on the following rather
; inobvious but very efficient test: 
; 
;	y =  dataWord + 0xFEFEFEFF
;	z = ~dataWord & 0x80808080
;	if ( y & z ) = 0 then all bytes in dataWord are non-zero
;
; The test maps any non-zero byte to zeros and any zero byte to 0x80,
; with one exception: 0x01 bytes preceeding the first zero are also
; mapped to 0x80.
