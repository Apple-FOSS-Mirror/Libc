 .Sh DESCRIPTION
-The three types of buffering available are unbuffered, block buffered,
-and line buffered.
+Three types of buffering are available:
+unbuffered, block buffered, and line buffered.
 When an output stream is unbuffered, information appears on the
 destination file or terminal as soon as written;
-when it is block buffered many characters are saved up and written as a block;
-when it is line buffered characters are saved up until a newline is
-output or input is read from any stream attached to a terminal device
