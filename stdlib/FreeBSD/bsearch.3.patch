 The

 function searches an array of
-.Fa nmemb
+.Fa nel
 objects, the initial member of which is
 pointed to by
 .Fa base ,
 for a member that matches the object pointed to by
 .Fa key .
-The size of each member of the array is specified by
-.Fa size .
+The size (in bytes) of each member of the array is specified by
+.Fa width .
 .Pp
 The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according
 to the comparison function referenced by

 is expected to have
 two arguments which point to the

+object and to an array member, in that order.
+It should return an integer which is
 less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the

 greater than the array member.
